Miscellaneous Xojo IDE Scripts
==============================

Miscellaneous scripts for the [Xojo IDE](http://www.xojo.com).

Scripts
-------

* `DebugBuild Wrap` - Wraps the selected text in `#If DebugBuild Then ... #EndIf`
* `If False Wrap` - Wraps the selected text in `#If False Then ... #EndIf` effectively
  commenting out large blocks of code
* `Find` and `Find Next` - Simple current editor only find/find next. I bind these scripts
  to `Ctrl+F` and `Ctrl+G` respectively (a Windows style shortcut)
* `Reload Project` - Reloads the current project. This comes in handy when you alter the project
  from an external source, such as your SCM system. I bind this to `Cmd+Shift+R`

If you like the scripts or use them, send me a note. If you find a bug, send me a bug patch or at the very least add an issue 
so I am aware of it.
